## Building the Project

Visual Studio or VS Code can be used to build the solution.
Note that the `Rhino.Licensing.AdminTool*` projects are not currently part of the solution or presently being maintained.

A full build, test, and pack run can be started using the `build.ps1` PowerShell script.

## Testing

Running the `build.ps1` will run unit tests for the project.

## Acknowledgements

Rhino Licensing is making use of the excellent log4net logging framework.
